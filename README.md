# get-your-work-done
Me and my employee created a to-do list that we call "Get Your Work Done".
It's a simple, clean app built to help students stay focused, track their progress, and actually get things done. We wanted it to feel like having a personal assistant that doesn't nag you but keeps everything organized in one place.

We designed it to be:

Fast: No unnecessary clicks or popups—just open, type, and boom—task added.

Friendly: The interface is clean, colorful, and motivating. Completing a task gives you a little "well done!" boost.

Flexible: You can add deadlines, mark tasks as complete, categorize them by project, and even sync them with GitHub Issues if you're a developer.

Whether you're planning a school project, managing a team, or just trying to remember to buy milk, Get Your Work Done is built for you.

And this is just the beginning—we're constantly improving it based on real feedback from users (and ourselves!). Our goal?
To help you stop procrastinating and start checking off that list—one task at a time.
